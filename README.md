# Vector-Space-Model
Information Retrieval Assignment 2

## Goal

This assignment focuses on Vector Space Model(VSM) for information retrieval. You will be implementing and testing a set of queries using VSM for information retrieval. You need to build a vector space of features using some specified feature selection techniques

## What you will create

You will be implementing term feature selection based on Term Frequency (tf) and Inverse Document Frequency (idf) scoring. The parameters of tf and idf can be set while creating a specific space of representation
